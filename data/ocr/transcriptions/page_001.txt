VOL. 18, NO. 1  MARCH, 1950      By mail to any address
                                      50c per year

THIS is the 205th issue of this little bulletin. With it we begin the eighteenth volume. Many of our readers have been with us since Vol. 1, No. 1 and quite a few of them have kept a complete file of all issues. We know this because occasionally a copy goes astray in the mail and they hasten to write for another copy stating that their files are complete except for that one number. We hope that the present volume will prove as interesting to these oldtimers as the previous ones. During the last few months we have been advertising THE NEW RECORDS in a number of leading newspapers throughout the country including The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Boston Herald, Detroit Free Press, Cleveland Press, St. Louis Star Times, Cincinnati Enquirer, Minneapolis Star Tribune and Washington Times Herald. Hundreds of new subscribers have been secured by this means and we take this opportunity of welcoming them with the hope that they will continue to find our little bulletin of value.

Last month we included a renewal blank with each copy mailed, and so many renewals were received that it has been impossible for us to check our mailing list. We are, therefore, carrying over all of our subscribers, whether they renewed or not. We cannot continue this practice beyond this month, so if you have not as yet sent in your renewal, you should do so at once in order that you will not miss any issues.

The demand for LP recordings, especially of classical music, is snowballing all over the country. Our readers are continually requesting us to list as many of them as we possibly can so that they may know what is available. This month we are making a very special effort to bring our readers up-to-date on the LP releases.

In doing so we have had to shorten many of our reviews in order to list more recordings in the space available. In so doing we hope we are pleasing the majority of our subscribers.

BACK COPIES
We are continually receiving requests for back copies of The New Records. Most of the issues published during the last seventeen years are available. The price is 5c each. A file of all of the available issues (at least 115 copies) is $5. These prices are postpaid within U.S.A.
