MARCH                               The New Records                         1950

ORCHESTRA

Bruckner: Symphony No. 5 in B-flat. Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Eugen Jochum. LP Microgroove only, 2-12" discs (CL-P8049 and CL-P8050) (automatic sequence). $9.70.

In May 1941 we reviewed the new release of the Bruckner Fifth as played by Karl Bohm and the Saxon State Orchestra (Victor DM-7701). Fortunately we did not rhapsodize too much over the performance, which we thought good and well played. It must be admitted that the Saxon State Orchestra plays the music better than the Hamburg Philharmonic, but Jochum's idea of the score is so much greater than Bohm's that his recording takes precedence. The reproduction is as good as Bohm's, if not better. It is therefore a pleasure to recommend this fine LP version of the Bruckner Fifth.

The advantages of Long Playing records may be enjoyed to their fullest in music such as Bruckner's. To suffer eighteen breaks in music of such long, grandiose, arching phrases and ideas is little more than idiotic. We can finally get an idea (outside of the concert hall) of what Bruckner is like when the idea is not constantly interrupted. No one has yet to our knowledge advanced a suitable reason why symphonies should last 30 to 40 minutes as the majority do. There is certainly no reason why one may not go on for an hour or more. If it is the type of music that pleases us, we can stand an hour easily, and we can enjoy an hour-long performance. Long Playing discs add greatly to the effect.

Bruckner was an organist, and an particularly fine improviser. His symphonies, it is said, are in many ways orchestrated organ improvisations of gigantic proportions, even though they are built on solid symphonic foundations. The score used in this performance is the original one, not the edited one. S.

Haydn: Symphony No. 101 in D major ("Clock"). Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. Seven sides, and Gluck: Orfeo ed Euridice — Dance of the Spirits. Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy, featuring William Kincaid (flute). 4-12" discs in album. Columbia Set MM-894. $6. LP Microgroove, coupled with Haydn: Symphony No. 92 in G major. Cleveland Orchestra conducted by George Szell. 1-12" disc (C-ML 4268). $4.85.

The climax of Haydn’s first visit to England was being awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music by Oxford University. Attendant upon the ceremonies were three brilliant and lengthy concerts in which many of the outstanding artists of the day took part. Haydn wrote a new symphony for one of these concerts—the work has not been adequately identified—but because he arrived at Oxford too late for sufficient rehearsals, it was necessary to substitute an older symphony. The one selected was the Symphony No. 92 in G major, forever after known as the "Oxford Symphony." It was received with tremendous enthusiasm.

As for Haydn’s reaction to Oxford, there remains only this record in a letter to a friend, "I had to pay one and a half guineas for the bell peals at Oxford (sic) when I received the doctor’s degree, and half a guinea for the robe. The journey cost six guineas."

The "Oxford" is a wonderfully vivacious work that is truly great music, and one seems to feel it while listening. For us it is a constant joy; we can’t imagine anyone not loving it.

The "Clock" is so called because of the slow movement in which Haydn imitates the tick-tock of an Eighteenth Century clock. There is nothing unusual about the rest of the work, although it is typically pleasant and good Haydn.

Detailed comment about the performances is unnecessary in our opinion for both are superb, razor-edged, virtuous renditions that are positively tops. There is enough resilience in both to keep them from being caricatures, and they are both recorded with a pleasing and appropriate perspective. They were reviewed from the LP disc, whose surfaces were good. S.

Tchaikowsky: Serenade in C major, Op. 48. Seven sides, and Mozart: The Impresario—Overture, K. 486. Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Serge Koussevitzky. 4-12" discs in album. RCA Victor Set DM-1346. $6.

While listening to this splendid album we could not help letting our thoughts digress for a moment concerning the record business. Without wishing to be too cryptic, caustic, or cynical, it is in a way ironic that on the eve of the demise of the 78 rpm, 12" shellac classical records, we have for a brief period enjoyed the highest quality these discs have known in this country. Consider the wretched quality of such discs during the war and for some time during the post-war period, we wonder how much more enjoyment could have been imparted to the multitude who purchased millions of the sand-paper surfaced discs if they could only have had their superb quality of the very discs in this album. They look beautiful, feel smooth to the touch, and are nearly free of surface noise when played.

The reproduction of Tchaikovsky Serenade is another fine achievement, for RCA Victor has something here that is good in balance, timbre, and perspective. Massed string tone is to be heard here.

The reproduction of Tchaikovsky Serenade is another fine achievement. The end.
