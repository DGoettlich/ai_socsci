in its most delicious form. Koussevitzky has always been an able hand with this work, and the present recording is indeed a fine one to add to the catalogs. It is all anyone could wish for, and the lovely, familiar Waltz movement will linger fondly in the memories of many who acquire the album. The opening movement and the finale, Tema Russo, are dramatically etched. The final side is devoted to a rather driving reading of the Mozart Impressario overture, a gay and witty piece, cut from the same cloth of Figaro and The Seraglio—charming as always. S.

Thomson: Louisiana Story. Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. 2-12" discs in album. Columbia Set MX-329. $3.50. LP Microgroove, coupled with Thomson: Five Portraits. Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Virgil Thomson. 1-10" disc (C-ML-2087). $3.85.

The orchestral suite, Louisiana Story, is taken from the music that Virgil Thomson supplied for Robert Flaherty’s semi-documentary picture of the same name. The score of the film was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1949.

The orchestral suite is in four movements: Pastoral, describing bayous, the boy in his rowboat, and the maneuvers of an amphibious bulldozer; Chorale, representing the boy playing in a tree with his pet raccoon; Passacaglia, recounting the boy’s adventure in robbing an alligator’s nest of its eggs; a chromatic Fugue of four movements, which in the film accompanies the boy’s fight to land an alligator he has hooked.

Much of Mr. Thomson’s music is entirely original but some of it is based on the folk tunes of the Acadians, those French-speaking folk who have inhabited the bayou region of Louisiana for several centuries. To us it was all very fascinating and as played by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy’s direction it makes a recording that we do not hesitate to recommend to anyone who will accept something a little out of the ordinary in musical fare.

Anderson: Irish Suite. Boston “Pops” Orchestra conducted by Arthur Fiedler. 3-10" discs in album. RCA Victor Set DM-1348. $4.

Leroy Anderson is a native of Cambridge, Mass., and graduated from the Music Department of Harvard University in 1929. He taught at Radcliffe College for two years and directed the Harvard Band for several years. He is an organist and choir master of unusual talents. Of late he has devoted nearly all of his time to composition. His Fiddle-Faddle; Chicken Reel; Sleigh Ride and Jazz Pizzicato are all quite well-known.

Mr. Anderson’s Irish Suite was commissioned by the Eire Society of Boston. It is dedicated to Arthur Fiedler and was given its first performance at Symphony Hall, Boston, in the spring of 1947 by the Boston “Pops” with Mr. Fiedler conducting. It consists of orchestral settings of six popular Irish melodies. They are: The Irish Washerwoman; The Minstrel Boy; The Rakes of Mallow; The Wearing of the Green; The Last Rose of Summer; and The Girl I Left Behind Me.

Here is gay and sentimental music that should warm the heart of any son of Erin.

Bizet: Carmen Suite. Columbia Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. 2-12" discs in album. Columbia Set MX-333. $3.50. LP Microgroove, coupled with Bizet: Carmen Suite. 1-12" disc (C-ML-4287). $4.85.

Capriccio Italien, Op. 45. Tchaikowsky: Capriccio Italien, Op. 45. Columbia Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. 2-12" discs in album. Columbia Set MX-334. $3.50. LP Microgroove, coupled with Capriccio Italien. 1-12" disc (C-ML-4287). $4.85.

Sir Thomas has recently signed an exclusive contract with Columbia and these recordings are the first that he has made under the new arrangement. The contract was probably signed before RCA Victor decided to issue LP recordings because it is said that one the reasons that Sir Thomas returned to Columbia was that he wished his recordings to be made available on LP discs.

Commercially both of the selections Sir Thomas has chosen will surely be big successes. They are the sort of things that the masses go for in a big way. We hope, however, that in the future this very fine conductor will select works that will hold more interest for the discerning music lover—works that require the great artistry that is his. Most any conductor can direct a fairly satisfactory performance of the Carmen Suite or Capriccio Italien. It doesn’t take a Sir Thomas for such pieces.

Gordon: The Rake’s Progress. Royal Opera House Orchestra, Covent Garden, conducted by Constant Lambert. LP Microgroove, coupled with Prokofiev: Cinderella (TNR Nov. ’49). 1-12" disc (C-ML-4229). $4.85.

The Rake’s Progress, with music by Gavin Gordon, is a lively ballet in the olden style. It tells the story of an 18th century libertine who spends his substance in amorous and corrupt adventures in London and finally ends his days in a madhouse. It was first produced by Sadler’s Wells Ballet during the 1930’s and has been repeated by that group numerous times with great success. Gordon’s music is sufficiently communicative to stand on its own legs and thus this orchestral version of the ballet is quite attractive. It is brilliantly performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra under the able direction of Constant Lambert. It is a fine example of English recording at its best.

Tchaikowsky: Symphony No. 5 in E minor, Op. 65. Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Wilhelm Mengelberg. LP Microgroove only, 1-12" disc (CL-P-8053). $4.85.

Several entirely satisfactory recordings of Tchaikovsky...
